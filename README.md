# Setup

1. Import [Naninovel visual novel engine](https://u3d.as/1pg9).
2. Run in editor or build the game.

In case the calendar UI is visible in the title menu and not changing values in game, try opening `Assets/Prefabs/Calendar`, then re-save it (change something inside the prefab and undo the change to dirty it first) and it should start working as expected.
